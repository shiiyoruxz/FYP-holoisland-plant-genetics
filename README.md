HoloIsland: Plant Genetics (FYP) 🌿🥽
A Mixed Reality / Virtual Reality Exploration of Botanical Genetics

📌 Project Overview
HoloIsland is a Final Year Project developed at TAR UMT that merges educational simulations with immersive technology. The project focuses on a Plant Genetics System, allowing users to interact with, breed, and observe the genetic evolution of virtual plant species in a 3D environment.

The goal of this project was to create a gamified learning experience where complex biological concepts—such as Mendelian inheritance and phenotypic expression—are visualized through interactive 3D models.

✨ Key Features
Genetic Simulation Engine: A backend system built in Chttps://www.google.com/search?q=%23 that handles DNA-like data structures to determine plant traits (color, height, leaf shape).

Procedural Growth & Interaction: Plants grow and change based on their genetic makeup, allowing for unique variations in every session.

Immersive XR Experience: Designed for VR/MR headsets, featuring intuitive hand-tracking or controller interactions for "gardening" and cross-pollination.

Real-time Data Visualization: Visual feedback systems that explain the genetic traits of a selected plant to the user.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Engine: Unity 2021.3 LTS

XR Framework: OpenXR / MRTK (Mixed Reality Toolkit)

Core Systems:

Inheritance Logic: ScriptableObject-based architecture to manage trait variations.

Optimization: Object pooling for plant instances to maintain high performance in VR.

UI/UX: Diegetic UI (in-world interfaces) to keep the user immersed in the HoloIsland environment.

🚀 Getting Started
